The fastest way to find MCP bundles and skills is the web registry at [mpak.dev](https://mpak.dev).

## Searching

Search by name, description, or keyword:

- Visit [mpak.dev](https://mpak.dev) and use the search bar
- Or from the CLI: `mpak bundle search <query>`

Both query the same [registry API](/registry/api), so results are identical.

{/* TODO: Document specific search filters available on mpak.dev when UI is finalized (e.g., filter by type, runtime, certification level, sort by downloads/recency) */}

<Aside>
  Search matches against package names, descriptions, and keywords defined in the manifest. More specific queries return better results: try `postgres` rather than `database`.
</Aside>

## Package Pages

Each package on mpak.dev has a detail page showing everything you need to evaluate it:

| Field | What It Tells You |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Name** | Scoped package name (`@org/server`) |
| **Version** | Latest published version |
| **Description** | What the server does |
| **Downloads** | Total download count (a rough trust signal) |
| **Certification** | Security level (L1-L4) from the [mpak Trust Framework](https://mpaktrust.org) |
| **Provenance** | Source repository, workflow, and commit hash |
| **Platforms** | Available platforms (e.g., darwin-arm64, linux-x64) |
| **Install command** | Copy-pasteable `mpak bundle run` command |
| **README** | Full README rendered from the source repository |

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of a package page when UI design is stable */}

## Evaluating a Package

Before running a bundle, look for these trust signals:

### Certification Level

The [mpak Trust Framework](/security/certification) assigns certification levels based on automated security scanning:

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **L1 (Basic)** | Meets minimum requirements (valid manifest, no embedded secrets) |
| **L2 (Standard)** | Pinned deps, vulnerability scanning, author identity |
| **L3 (Verified)** | Signed bundles, build provenance, SLSA |
| **L4 (Attested)** | Behavioral sandbox, reproducible builds |

Higher levels mean more security controls were verified.

### Provenance

A verified provenance badge means the bundle was built in a GitHub Actions workflow and the registry verified the OIDC token. You can trace the bundle back to the exact commit that produced it. See [Provenance](/security/provenance).

### Other Signals

- **Download count**: Higher downloads suggest wider adoption (but not necessarily quality)
- **Last updated**: Recent updates suggest active maintenance
- **Publisher**: Check the org/user's other packages and GitHub profile

## CLI Alternative

Everything visible on mpak.dev is also accessible from the terminal:

```bash
# Search for packages (table with NAME, VERSION, TRUST, DESCRIPTION)
mpak bundle search postgres

# View package details (includes Trust section with certification level)
mpak bundle show @nimblebraininc/postgres-mcp
```

The CLI search displays a table with a **TRUST** column showing the certification level (`L1`-`L4` or `-` if not scanned). The `show` command includes a full Trust section with the level name and controls passed.

See [search](/cli/search) and [show](/cli/show) for full CLI documentation.
