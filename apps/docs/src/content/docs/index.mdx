mpak is a package registry for distributing capabilities that make AI agents smarter. Think **npm for AI agents**.

mpak distributes [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers and Agent Skills. MCP is an open standard that lets AI agents connect to external tools and data sources through a unified interface.

```bash
# Search for MCP bundles
mpak bundle search postgres

# Run an MCP server instantly
mpak bundle run @nimblebraininc/echo
```

No manual dependency installation. No configuration. Just works.

## The Problem

AI agents are generalists. They become powerful when you give them specialized tools and knowledge. But distributing these capabilities is a mess:

- **MCP servers** require manual dependency management and complex setup
- **Skills** are copy-pasted between projects with no versioning
- **Discovery** means searching GitHub and hoping you find something that works

Registries solved this problem for every other ecosystem: npm for JavaScript, PyPI for Python, crates.io for Rust. mpak does the same for AI agent capabilities. [Learn why a registry matters.](/why-a-registry)

## Two Types of Capabilities

mpak distributes two types of agent capabilities:
