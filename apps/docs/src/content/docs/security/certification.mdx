description: Understanding mpak's security certification for MCP bundles

import { CardGrid, LinkCard, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Every bundle published to mpak is automatically scanned against the [mpak Trust Framework (MTF)](https://mpaktrust.org), an open security standard for MCP server bundles. The results determine your bundle's **certification level** (L1-L4).

<Aside type="tip">
The full framework specification, including all 41 controls and their criteria, lives at [mpaktrust.org](https://mpaktrust.org). This guide focuses on what publishers need to know.

## Quick Reference

| Level | Name | Controls | What It Means |
|-------|------|----------|---------------|
| **L1** | Basic | 7 | No secrets, no malware, valid manifest, SBOM |
| **L2** | Standard | 26 | + Vuln scanning, pinned deps, author identity |
| **L3** | Verified | 38 | + Signed bundles, build provenance, SLSA |
| **L4** | Attested | 41 | + Behavioral sandbox, reproducible builds |

Most well-structured servers achieve **L1** or **L2** automatically.

## What Gets Checked

Controls span nine security domains:

| Domain | Code | Examples |
|--------|------|----------|
| Artifact Integrity | AI | Valid manifest, content hashes, signatures |
| Supply Chain | SC | SBOM, vulnerability scan, dependency pinning |
| Code Quality | CQ | No secrets, no malware, static analysis |
| Capability Declaration | CD | Tool descriptions, permission scopes |
| Provenance | PR | Source repo, author identity, build attestation |
| Registry Operations | RG | Namespace governance, name pattern review |
| Publisher Identity | PK | Identity verification, key rotation |
| Installation | IN | Pre-install checks, user transparency |
| Update Lifecycle | UP | Version policy, deprecation process |

### MCP-Specific Threats

Three controls target AI attack surfaces that traditional tools miss:

- **CD-03: Tool description poisoning** - prompt injection in tool descriptions
- **CD-04: Credential blast radius** - overly broad OAuth scopes
- **CQ-06: Behavioral mismatch** - runtime behavior differs from declarations

Slopsquatting (packages named after LLM hallucinations) is handled by RG-02 namespace governance.

## Viewing Results

Every package page on [mpak.dev](https://mpak.dev) shows:

- Certification level badge
- Risk score
- Individual control results (pass/fail/skip)
- Remediation guidance for failures
