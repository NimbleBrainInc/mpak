Every package on mpak has a scoped name in the format `@scope/name`. The scope is derived from your GitHub identity, and the registry enforces ownership cryptographically.

## The Format

```
@scope/name
```

| Part | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| `@scope` | Your GitHub org or username (lowercased) | `@nimblebraininc` |
| `name` | The package identifier you choose | `postgres-mcp` |
| Full name | Combined | `@nimblebraininc/postgres-mcp` |

## Scope Rules

Your scope is automatically derived from the GitHub OIDC token at publish time. You cannot choose a different scope.

| GitHub Owner | Package Scope |
|--------------|--------------|
| `NimbleBrainInc` (org) | `@nimblebraininc/...` |
| `johndoe` (user) | `@johndoe/...` |
| `My-Org` (org) | `@my-org/...` |

Scopes are always lowercase. GitHub owner names are lowercased automatically.

This means:
- You can only publish packages under your own scope
- No one else can publish to your scope
- Scope ownership is verified cryptographically via OIDC (no API keys, no manual approval)

## Name Rules

Package names (the part after the scope) must follow these rules:

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens | `postgres-mcp` |
| Must start with a letter | `my-server` (not `1-server`) |
| No consecutive hyphens | `my-server` (not `my--server`) |
| No leading or trailing hyphens | `server` (not `-server-`) |

{/* TODO: Confirm exact character restrictions, min/max length limits from registry validation */}

## Naming Best Practices

**Be descriptive.** The name should tell users what the server connects to or does.

| Good | Bad | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| `postgres-mcp` | `my-server` | Tells users what it connects to |
| `github-issues` | `tool` | Specific about what it does |
| `slack-notifications` | `notifications` | Names the integration |
| `code-review` | `helper` | Describes the capability |

**Include the service or protocol name** when wrapping an API: `stripe-mcp`, `jira-mcp`, `openai-mcp`.

**Avoid generic names** like `utils`, `tools`, `helper`, `core`. These don't help users discover your package.

**Don't include your org name** in the package name. The scope already identifies you: `@yourorg/postgres-mcp`, not `@yourorg/yourorg-postgres-mcp`.

## Namespace Governance

The mpak Trust Framework includes [RG-02 namespace governance](https://mpaktrust.org) controls to prevent squatting and name confusion:

- **Slopsquatting prevention**: Names that are confusingly similar to popular packages may be flagged
- **Trademark enforcement**: Package names impersonating well-known brands may be removed

<Aside>
  Namespace governance policies are enforced reactively today. If you believe a package name infringes on your trademark or is squatting on your namespace, contact us via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/mpak/issues).

## Renaming and Transfers

{/* TODO: Document rename/transfer policy when available. Currently, renaming a package requires publishing under the new name and deprecating the old one. */}

Package names are immutable once published. To "rename" a package:

1. Publish a new package under the desired name
2. Deprecate the old package (point users to the new one)
3. The old name remains reserved to prevent confusion
