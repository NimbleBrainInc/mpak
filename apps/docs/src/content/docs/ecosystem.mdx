## Featured Bundles

{/* TODO: Replace with actual featured packages and real download counts */}

Bundles give agents the ability to **do things**: query databases, call APIs, interact with external systems.

| Bundle | Description | Runtime |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `@nimblebraininc/echo` | Echo server for testing MCP integrations | Python |
| `@nimblebraininc/ipinfo` | IP address geolocation and network info | Python |

Browse all bundles at [mpak.dev](https://mpak.dev) or search from the CLI:

```bash
mpak bundle search <query>
```

## Featured Skills

{/* TODO: Replace with actual featured skills once the ecosystem grows */}

Skills give agents **domain knowledge**: how to review code, analyze contracts, follow sales methodology.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Coming soon | Skills are a new package type. [Publish the first one.](/skills/overview) |

## Publishing Your Own

Have an MCP server on GitHub? You can publish it to mpak in 10 minutes:

1. Add a `manifest.json` to your repo
2. Add a GitHub Actions workflow (3 lines of YAML)
3. Create a release

That's it. No account creation, no API keys, no approval process.

```bash
# After publishing, verify it's live
mpak bundle search your-server-name
```
