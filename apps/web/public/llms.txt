# mpak

> mpak is the secure, open-source package registry for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and Agent Skills. Standardized packaging, automated security scanning, and public trust scores for AI tool distribution.

mpak is available at [mpak.dev](https://www.mpak.dev). Install the CLI with `npm install -g @nimblebrain/mpak`.

## Package Types

mpak hosts two types of packages:

**Bundles** are pre-packaged MCP servers in the MCPB format that give AI agents new capabilities (database access, API integrations, file operations). They work cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows) and install with a single command: `mpak bundle pull @scope/name`.

**Skills** are markdown instructions that teach AI agents new behaviors and domain expertise (code review patterns, writing styles, specialized knowledge). They follow the Agent Skills specification and work across AI platforms. Install with: `mpak skill install @scope/name`.

## Security Model

Every bundle published to mpak is scanned by the mpak Trust Framework (MTF) with 25 security controls across 5 domains:

- **Supply Chain (SC)**: Dependencies are known, vulnerability-free, and from trusted sources
- **Code Quality (CQ)**: Code is free from secrets, malware, and security defects
- **Artifact Integrity (AI)**: Bundle has not been tampered with and can be verified
- **Provenance (PR)**: Origin and build process are verifiable and trustworthy
- **Capability Declaration (CD)**: Bundles accurately declare their capabilities and permissions

Certification levels:

- **L1 Basic** (6/25 controls): No embedded secrets, no malware patterns, valid manifest. For personal projects.
- **L2 Standard** (14/25 controls): CVE + EPSS vulnerability scanning, dependency pinning, anti-slopsquatting, tool description safety. For teams.
- **L3 Verified** (22/25 controls): Cryptographic bundle signatures, build provenance attestation, OpenSSF Scorecard. For production.
- **L4 Attested** (25/25 controls): Behavioral analysis sandbox, reproducible builds, full provenance chain. For critical infrastructure.

MCP-specific controls unique to mpak:

- **Tool Description Safety (CD-03)**: Detects prompt injection in MCP tool descriptions
- **Anti-Slopsquatting (CQ-06)**: Blocks packages named after LLM-hallucinated package names
- **Credential Scope Declaration (CD-04)**: Enforces minimal declared OAuth scopes
- **Behavioral Analysis (CQ-07)**: Isolated sandbox monitoring of runtime behavior

## CLI Usage

```
npm install -g @nimblebrain/mpak
mpak search postgres
mpak bundle pull @mcp/server-postgres
mpak skill install @scope/skill-name
```

## Publishing

Publishers add a `manifest.json` to their MCP server repo and the `mcpb-pack` GitHub Action. On release, the action builds the MCPB bundle, scans it with MTF, computes a trust score, and publishes to the registry automatically.
